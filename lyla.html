    <p><b>Hi there! My name is Lyla. I'm only 11 years old and bake for my friends, family, and donate money from bake sales. I have been doing this for a long time untill I feel in love with baking. The first ever recipe I made is a batch of cupcakes. And I know your probaly thinking, cupcakes? I could easily do that. Well.... Probaly not. I call these cupcakes, Christmas Pepermint Cupcakes. I know it's kinda a dumpy name. But ya. I actually made this recipe during quarantine in 2020. It turns out I really like this and I am SUPER exited to share this journey with YOU! So as an intro.. Welcome to my Baking Blog! :)</b></p>
